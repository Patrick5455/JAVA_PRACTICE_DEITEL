Write an application that plays “guess the number” as follows:
Your program chooses the number to be guessed by selecting a random integer in the range 1 to 1000.
The application displays the prompt Guess a number between 1 and 1000. The player inputs a first
guess.
If the player's guess is incorrect, your program should display Too high. Try again. or Too
low. Try again.
to help the player “zero in” on the correct answer. The program should prompt the
user for the next guess. When the user enters the correct answer, display Congratulations. You
guessed the number!, and allow the user to choose whether to play again.

(Guess the Number Modification) Modify the program of Exercise 6.30 to count the number
of guesses the player makes. If the number is 10 or fewer, display Either you know the secret
or you got lucky! If the player guesses the number in 10 tries, display Aha! You know the secret!
If the player makes more than 10 guesses, display You should be able to do better! Why should it
take no more than 10 guesses? Well, with each “good guess,” the player should be able to eliminate
half of the numbers, then half of the remaining numbers, and so on.
