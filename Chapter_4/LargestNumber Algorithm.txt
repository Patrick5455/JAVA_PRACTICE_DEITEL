LargestNumber Algorithm

Goal: a Java application that inputs a series of 10 integers and determines and prints the largest integer.

First Refinement
1. Declare ;Largest number as 0
2. Collect number from user
3. Compare each number from user with largest number
4. If number from user is greater than largest number, store input from user as largest number

Second Refinement
1. Declare and initialise the following variables as 0
	- int Counter =0;
	int number =0;
	int largest = 0;
2. while (input.hasNext)
	collect number from user
	 If number is greater than largest 	
		print largest number.
