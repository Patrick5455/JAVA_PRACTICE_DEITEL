public class Statements{

// Write Java statements to accomplish each of the following tasks:

public static void main (String... args){

//1. Use one statement to assign the sum of x and y to z, then increment x by 1.

int x = 0;
int y = 0;

int z = x+y;

x+=1;

//2.Test whether variable count is greater than 10. If it is, print "Count is greater than 10".

int count = 0;

System.out.println(count > 10 ? "Count is greater than 10" : "");


//3. Use one statement to decrement the variable x by 1, then subtract it from variable total and store the result in variable total.

int total = 0;
x-=1;

System.out.println(total = total - x);

//4. Calculate the remainder after q is divided by divisor, and assign the result to q. Write this statement in two different ways.
