Algorithm for Factorials between 1-20

Goal: Write an application that calculates and displays the factorials of 1-20

First Refinement:
Collect number from counter 
decrement number till 1
multiply number by the first decrement
multiply the next decrement by previous decrement till 1
assign result to factorial of number

Second Refinement:

1.initialise variables number, factorial (counter (method 2)) as integers

2. collect integer from user and assign to number

3a. while number is greater than or eual to 1
decrement the value of number 
Or
3a.initialise a counter to value 1, while counter is lesser than or eual to number
increment the value of counter

4a. multiply the value of each decrement by the next decrement starting from the number multiplied by the first decrement
4b. multiply the value of counter with next counter starting from the initial value of counter

5. Assign the value of the product to factorial
