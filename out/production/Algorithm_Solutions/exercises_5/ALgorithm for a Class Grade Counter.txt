ALgorithm for a Class Grade Counter

Goal: Calaculate the average score for a class and display the number of students in each of the grades

First Refinement: 
1. Collect and save scores from the user
2. Assign each score to a grade
3. Calcualte the average score, the total score.
4. Display the number of students in eachh grades

Second Refinement
1. Declare variables
	Total, Score, gradeA, gradeB, gradeC. gradeD, gradeF, 	gradeCounter= 0;
2. Instatiate a Scanner object with method to collect score from user
3. Determine a sentinel value to stop user input
4. Prompt user to input  score or sentinel value to stop the input
4. While user input does not equal to sentinel value
	instatiate variable score with Scanner object and method and 			collect and store input from the user to score
	Add value of score to total in variable total
	increase gradeCounter by 1
	Delcare a Switch statement with an argument that divides score by 	10 to get single digit value.
	 Declare cases for each grades with increment  for the grades
	Cases 9 & 10 - ++gradeA
	Case 8 - ++gradeB
	Case 7 - ++gradeC
	Case 6 - ++gradeD
	default case -grade f

8. if gradeCounter does not equal to zero 
	divide total score by gradeCounter
 	Display number of total score and number of scores
	Display number of  scores in each grade category

9. else print no grade was entered
