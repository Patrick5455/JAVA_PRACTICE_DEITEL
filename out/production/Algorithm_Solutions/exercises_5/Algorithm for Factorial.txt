First Refinement:

Collect number from user,
decrement number till 1
multiply each number by the first decrement
multiply the next decrement by previous decrement till 1
assign result to factorial of number

Second Refinement:

1.initialise variables number, factorial, factors, and counter as integers

2. collect integer from user and assign to number

3. while counter is less than or eual to 1
decrement the value of number and 

4. multiply the value of each decrement by the next decrement starting from the number multiplied by the first decrement

5. Assign the value of the product to factorial
