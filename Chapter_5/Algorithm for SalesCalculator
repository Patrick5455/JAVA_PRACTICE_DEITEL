Algorithm for SalesCalculator

Goal: Create an application that reads a series of pairs of number as follows: product num and qty sold. The application should calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold.

First Refinement:
1. Get the product number and qty sold of all items that were sold 
2. Calculate the retail value for each product sold 
3. Calculate the total retail value for all products sold


Second refinement
1. Set the unit price for each product number
2. From user, collect product number and qty sold for each product number
3. User should keep adding product and qty sold for each product till they cancel application
4. multiply each product number by the qty sold and store as retail value 
5.  add together the retial value of all product no entered
6. display the total retail value

Third refinenement
1. initialise instance variables for each product number with thier unit price as values 
int product 1 = $, int product 2 = $, .....
intialise instance variable int totalRetailValue =0;
2. initalise instance varible to collect product num and qty sold as 0
int productNum =0; int qtySold =0;
3. while (input.hasNext()) 
	collect productnum
	switch (producNUm)
		case 1:
		collect qty sold 
		productNum1 = productnum1*qtySold
		return productNum1;
		break;

		etc. 
		
	totalRetailValue = addition of all productnum entered
4. method to display totalRetailValue
