TwoLargestNumber Algorithm

Goal: a Java application that inputs a series of integers and determines and prints the two largest integers.

First Refinement:
store = firstnumber
1. Collect input from user (20)
2. if input is greater than 2nd no and less than first number, input = 2nd no (9)
3. else if input is greater than 2nd and greater than or equal to 1st no,
	2nd no = store
	1st no = input (0)
4. print 1st and 2nd no (10, 9)
