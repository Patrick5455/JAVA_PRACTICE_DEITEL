mpgCalculator Algorithm

Goal: The application should show the mpg for each trip and mpg for all trip

First refinement:

-Instantiate variables
-Show the mpg  in a trip
-Show the total mpg for all trips

Second Refinement: 

-Instantiate variable miles to zero
-Instantiate variable gallon to zero
-nstantiate variable total miles to zero
-Instantiate variable total gallon to zero
-Instantiate no of trip to zero

-Enter 0 to cancel application
-prompt collect and save value for  no of miles (continue if input is not 0 )
-add value of miles to total miles 

-while no of miles is not equal to 0
	prompt collect and save value for  no of gallon
	add value of gallon to total gallon

	if miles and gallon do not equal to zero
		divide miles by gallon & save as variable mpg as double 
		print mpg

	Enter 0 to check total mileage per gallon (if not loop continues)

	prompt collect and save value for  no of miles                          	(continue if input is not 0 )
	add value of miles to total miles 
	
	increament no of trip by 1

- divide total miles by total gallon
-print total mpg
